Dear XXX,

Congratulations on your recent publication "XXX".  
 
We think that the epigenetics community could greatly benefit from your findings and would like to make them conveniently searchable via our online database The EWAS Catalog (http://www.ewascatalog.org/).  

The EWAS Catalog contains meta-data and summary statistics from over 1000 of the most informative EWAS published in the last 10 years. 
 
If you would like to have your EWAS added to the The EWAS Catalog, you can simply fill out an online form for describing each EWAS in your publication and upload corresponding spreadsheets containing their summary statistics.  
 
Online form: https://form.jotform.com/211644540717049 
Summary statistics upload link: https://www.dropbox.com/request/VnT7EMgWJAqnXaWtII92
 
The online form will request information about each EWAS in your publication. If you have multiple EWAS analyses in your publication, you simply need to click "Add another EWAS" after adding in your initial EWAS information and the online form will pre-populate with the previous input, so you need not fill out the same information multiple times. 
 
Weâ€™d be happy to hear any questions or comments you have about The EWAS Catalog or the EWAS upload procedure. To get in touch please either reply to this email or email us at ewascatalog@outlook.com.  

Kind regards,
Thomas Battram, Matthew Suderman and Paul Yousefi on behalf of The EWAS Catalog Team
