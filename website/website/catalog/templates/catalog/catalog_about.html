   <h1>Introduction</h1>
   <p class="small">&nbsp;</p> 
   <p>The EWAS Catalog was developed and is maintained by the Intergrative Epidemiology Unit (IEU) at the University of Bristol. The Catalog was founded by the IEU in October 2017 by James Staley and was developed to enable the scientific community to search results from epigenome-wide association studies of DNA methylation. <br></br> The Catalog currently contains results at <i>p</i> &lt 1&times10<sup>-4</sup> from three sources. Firstly, results were extracted from the literature. Secondly, EWAS were performed in the Accessible Resource for Epigenomics Studies (ARIES) subsection of the <a href="http://www.bristol.ac.uk/alspac/" target="_blank">Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC)</a> cohort. Thirdly, publically available data from the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/" target="_blank">Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)</a> database were extracted using the <a href="https://github.com/yousefi138/geograbi" target="_blank">geograbi R package</a> and EWAS were performed on these data after quality control. Further details of how studies were identified and the published data extraction process are available in the <a href="{% url 'catalog_documents' %}" >documentation</a>.</p>
